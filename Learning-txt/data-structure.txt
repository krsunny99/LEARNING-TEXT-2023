DAY - 1 (23aug)

#####1

Data Structure - Managing data so that we can use it in better way.

algorithm - process/way to manage that data.

linear - in which operation can be performed at only start and  end.

non-linear - in which operation can be performed at any where

operations on datastructure
       -Traversal
       -insertion
       -deletion
       -searching
       -sorting
       -merging

######2

--array traversing with for-loop

DAY-2(24aug)
  
space complexity - memory, no of varibales we have created, amount of space req. to resolve a program.

time complexity - no lines to execute a program , not machine dependent

DAY-3(25 aug)

Big O notation - used to denote complexity.

ASYMTOPIC NOTATION AND ANALYSIS

fn = 5n**2 + 6n + 12

asymtopic analysis tells which algo is best for this particular data

***Array Sorting :
  bubble sorting	

DAY 4(29 aug)

Recursion-1> Direct            2>Indirect

simple recursion is called direct recursion

indirect recursion example 

function apple(){        <-------- >                      function bnanaa(){
                                                              apple()
   banana()                                                  }  bnana()
}
apple()
